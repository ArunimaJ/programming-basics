# My First Beginning with Programming

I would like to share whatever I am going to learn throughout this coding bootcamp. This will be a series of posts which has my experience, some snipets of code and also some diagrams. This is to keep a record of all my learnings which will be useful for reference in the future. It may also be helpful for beginners who want to learn coding. 


## What I have learnt

Before I started the coding class, I didn’t find much appeal in coding or python.
 To me, anything associated with computers was cramming incoherent words and using all my will power to memorize incomprehensible pieces of coding.
  My mom suggested a coding class and after some reluctance, I gave in and I’m glad I did.
  
 Meeting my coach and mentor through
online class made it easier for me to open up to the world of coding.
 He explained it by giving practical examples which made me relatable and interesting, As I delved deeper in the world of coding, I began to appreciate and adore it.
 In the past five classes, I have learnt so much more than what I ever learned in school.
 I acquired knowledge of the basics and logistics on which computer works and the various discs in our computer.
  It stimulated questions that I had never bothered to ask. I learnt how to create a disc and partition it by shrinking the storage used. In the first two classes,
I comprehended the hardware, software, and the working of the computer. Before going in deep, you need to understand the
surface beforehand. The next class was on ‘Git’ which is an open source control system that works on merging codes and
hence makes it easier for coders and software developers all around the world. I logged in at ‘GitHub’ and set up 
various other code prompts and coding platforms. This shed light to the concept of ‘Repository’ which is a storage
location in Git. Pushing files into the main repository required me to extract them and first file them in the local repository.
Then came ‘cmder’ which was command prompt and helped us create folders and files with using just our keyboard and simple codes
that were much more convenient. I learnt the syntax of Markdown, which was the much more improved ‘HTML’ and learnt how to use
Visual Code Programming. Recently, I finally pushed a file in the GitHub to share it with the world. I was also enlightened by
the knowledge of the icons in Vs Code and the in-built extensions used in it. In the last class, I learnt how to clone, 
commit and push the code from both platforms; Visual code and Command line.  Just these five classes opened a new door 
of opportunities for me and as I continue…I know there will be many more. 


### Here are some of the commands that I learnt.

> cd : change directory 

```
C:\users
cd c:\users\projects

```
> mkdir : create a new directory 

```
C:\users
mkdir School 
mkdir D:\projects\school

```
> ls : to view a list of files in the directory 

```
C:\users
ls 
filter files based on keyword (wildcard)
ls m*
show me all the files starting with 'm'
ls *m 
show me all the files ending with 'm' 
ls m*n 
show me all the files that start with 'm' and end with 'n' 

```
